"quantum approximate optimization algorithm" test programs. Basic block 
in small scale is the "QAOA_basic" with all distinct parameters,
having 2 steps in the "entangle-rotation" manner;
we twist "QAOA_basic" into "QAOA_shared" by making some gates share parameters;
we create multi-layer structure `using if-control or the while loop.
We also made larger scales of multi-layer structures in "_medium"
and "_large"'s.
