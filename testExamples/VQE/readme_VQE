"variational quantum eigensolver" test programs. Basic block 
in small scale is the "VQE_basic" with all distinct parameters,
having three steps in the "rotation-entangle-rotation" order;
we twist "VQE_basic" into "VQE_shared" by making some gates share parameters;
we create multi-layer structure using if-control or the while loop.
We also made larger scales of multi-layer structures in "_medium"
and "_large"'s.
