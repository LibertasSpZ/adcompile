These two programs are from Section 8.1 to demonstrate the advantage 
of controls. noIf.txt is a sequence of 2 * 12 rotations with 2 sets 
of different parameters, and withIf.txt is 12 rotations followed by
a case-controled choice of 12 rotations, all with different parameters.
Note that compatible with our parsing syntax, {t1 ~ t12} correspond to 
{theta_1~theta_{12}}, in the manuscript, {t13 ~ t24} correspond to 
{phi_1 ~ phi_{12}}, and {t25 ~ t36} correspond to {psi_1 to psi_{12}}.
