"quantum neural net" test programs. Basic block 
in small scale is the "QNN_basic" with all distinct parameters,
having 2 steps in the "X/Z rotation -> XX entanglement" order;
we twist "QNN_basic" into "QNN_shared" by making some gates share parameters;
we create multi-layer structure using if-control or the while loop.
We also made larger scales of multi-layer structures in "_medium"
and "_large"'s.
